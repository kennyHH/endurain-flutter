## What is Endurain Mobile?

Endurain Mobile is the official companion app for [Endurain](https://github.com/endurain-project/endurain), a self-hosted fitness tracking service. Built with Flutter, it provides a native mobile experience for tracking your fitness activities while maintaining full control over your data.

The app is designed with privacy in mind, connecting directly to your self-hosted Endurain server without any third-party services or analytics.

## Current Features

✅ **Authentication**
- Secure login to your Endurain server with PKCE-backed token exchange
- SSO/OAuth support with PKCE (Authentik, Keycloak, Authelia, PocketID, Casdoor, etc.)
- Two-factor authentication (MFA) support
- Auto-redirect for single SSO provider configurations
- Server URL configuration with automatic settings detection
- Access-token refresh and local session restoration

✅ **Map Integration**
- Real-time location display on OpenStreetMap
- Location lock/unlock with visual indicators (filled/outline arrow icons)
- Auto-centering map when location is locked
- Configurable map tile server
- Directional compass heading indicator
- Platform-adaptive UI (Cupertino for iOS/macOS, Material for Android)

✅ **Activity Recording**
- Activity type selection for running, riding, walking, hiking, and other activities
- Start, pause, resume, stop, and discard recording controls directly on the map
- Live activity statistics for duration, distance, and speed
- GPS track capture with elapsed-time tracking across pauses and resumes
- Background location tracking while a recording is active, including Android foreground-service notification support and iOS Always-location guidance
- Location permission and disabled-location error handling, including app settings shortcut
- Stop confirmation flow with discard option
- GPX 1.1 generation from completed tracks
- Direct GPX upload to the Endurain activity import endpoint after a recording completes
- Completed activity retention in private app storage, including local summary metadata, GPX availability, and upload state
- Non-destructive post-upload flow with `Done`, `View history`, retry, and explicit delete actions
- Local activity history and details screens for completed recordings saved on the device

✅ **Settings**
- Server configuration management
- Map tile server customization
- Local activity history entry point and uploaded-GPX retention preference
- Logged-in server and username summary
- Local diagnostics view with privacy-filtered crash context, recording breadcrumbs, copy, and clear actions
- Session management with server-side logout attempt and secure local cleanup
- App version display

✅ **User Experience**
- Multi-language support (English, Portuguese)
- Dark/light theme support
- Secure local session storage
- Shared adaptive widget layer for Material and Cupertino controls
- Local SSO provider icon assets with remote icon fallback

## Roadmap

🚧 **Next Activity Milestones**
- Add a richer local post-recording summary for completed activities before or after upload
- Add manual GPX export/share
- Add server-synced activity history and details once the server exposes stable imported activity metadata
- Improve activity import feedback once the server exposes richer post-upload status and metadata
- Expand activity statistics as server/mobile contracts mature

See the [Activity Tracking MVP Plan](devdocs/activity_tracking_mvp_plan.md) and [Completed Activity Local Retention Plan](devdocs/activity_local_retention_plan.md) for implementation notes and remaining activity work.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK 3.38 or higher
- Dart SDK 3.10.3 or higher
- Xcode (for iOS/macOS development)
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- A running Endurain server instance

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/endurain-project/endurain-flutter.git
cd endurain-flutter
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Generate localization files:
```bash
flutter gen-l10n
```

4. Run the app:
```bash
# For iOS
flutter run -d ios

# For Android
flutter run -d android

# For macOS
flutter run -d macos
```

### Android Device Setup

For Android development, install Android Studio and use its SDK Manager to
install the Android SDK, Platform-Tools, Build-Tools, Command-line Tools, and the
required Android platform packages. Then accept SDK licenses:

```bash
flutter doctor --android-licenses
flutter doctor -v
```

To run on a physical Android device, enable Developer options and USB debugging
on the device, connect it with a data-capable USB cable, and accept the USB
debugging authorization prompt. Verify that Flutter sees the device before
running the app:

```bash
flutter devices
flutter run -d <android-device-id>
```

The Android app module has been migrated to Flutter's Built-in Kotlin Gradle
support. Current Android builds can still show upstream plugin warnings for
dependencies that have not completed that migration yet, such as endorsed or
transitive platform plugins. If the debug build succeeds, track those warnings
with dependency updates rather than editing files in the local pub cache.

## SSO/OAuth Callback

SSO providers must redirect back to the app with this callback URL:

```text
endurain://auth/sso/callback
```

The callback currently expects a `session_id` query parameter, for example:

```text
endurain://auth/sso/callback?session_id=...
```

Register this callback URL in the Endurain server or identity provider configuration used for mobile SSO.

## Local Diagnostics

The app keeps a local diagnostics report to help investigate field issues when a tethered Flutter or Xcode console is not available. Open **Settings > Diagnostics** after relaunching the app to review recent events, captured Flutter/Dart errors, and the raw privacy-filtered report.

Diagnostics are stored only in the app's private support directory and are never uploaded automatically. The report keeps high-level lifecycle context such as app startup, activity recording start/pause/resume/stop, failure reasons, point-count milestones, and catchable Flutter/Dart errors. It intentionally avoids raw GPS coordinates and sanitizes token-like values, home/container paths, and coordinate-looking strings before saving.

iOS `.ips` crash reports remain separate system-generated native crash reports. The local diagnostics report complements them by preserving app-side context from before the crash.

## Development Workflow

Run static analysis:

```bash
flutter analyze
```

Run tests:

```bash
flutter test
```

Collect coverage and check a minimum line coverage threshold:

```bash
flutter test --coverage
dart run tool/check_coverage.dart --min-line-coverage 75 \
  --exclude "lib/l10n/app_localizations*.dart"
```

Regenerate localization classes after changing ARB files:

```bash
flutter gen-l10n
```

Localization source files live in `lib/l10n/app_en.arb` and `lib/l10n/app_pt.arb`. Every ARB entry must include resource attributes because `l10n.yaml` enables `required-resource-attributes`.

## Building from Source

### iOS

```bash
flutter build ios --release
```

### Android

Debug builds do not require release signing credentials:

```bash
flutter build apk --debug
```

Release builds require Android signing configuration. Copy
`android/key.properties.example` to ignored `android/key.properties` and fill it
locally, or provide the documented `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_*` environment variables in
CI.

```bash
flutter build apk --release
# or for App Bundle
flutter build appbundle --release
```

### macOS

```bash
flutter build macos --release
```
